## Lab 7 - Machine Learning with Python Language and Power BI Inside Jupyter Notebook

Imagine that a company has historical data on customers who purchased products or services. Data includes, for each customer: age, annual income and a spending score (customer purchasing power).

The company would like to segment these customers into 3 groups according to similarities in order to personalize Marketing campaigns. The Marketing area manager expects to receive a report with the 3 segments and for each segment the average age, annual income and spending score of the customers.

Your job is to make this happen! And for that you will need Machine Learning. Let's work with fictitious data.
