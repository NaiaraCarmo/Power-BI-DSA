## Lab 9 - Production Engineering with Power BI and AI Predicting Industrial Production Over Time

In this Lab, Power BI is used to manipulate and understand data, exploring some time series analysis concepts. Finally, Power BI AI capabilities for predicting average units produced over time and anomaly detection are presented. The Dashboard created at the end of the Lab serves as a starting point for the daily lives of Production Engineers. The data used in the Lab is fictitious.
