# What is Business Intelligence?

Business Intelligence (BI) is a set of techniques and tools used to transform data into useful information for business decision-making. BI allows users to analyze data from different sources, create reports and visualizations, and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) to help identify trends and opportunities. BI tools include reports, dashboards, data mining, statistical analysis, and even Artificial Intelligence.

We typically use BI in order to look into the past and understand what happened. What was the sales volume by state? Which products sold the most on which day of the week? Which stores had the best sales performance? These are all questions typically answered with BI.

There are many examples of how Business Intelligence (BI) can be used to improve decision-making in different industries. Some examples include:

In finance, a company can use BI to analyze financial data, such as revenue, expenses, and profit, to identify trends and predict future results. This can help identify opportunities for savings and growth.

A company can use BI to analyze sales data such as sales volume, revenue, and profit margin to identify trends and opportunities. This can help you identify products or regions that are performing well or poorly and take steps to increase sales.

In operations, a company can use BI to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), such as production cycle time, defect rate, and equipment availability, to identify problems and opportunities for improvement.

In human resources, a company can use BI to analyze employee data such as turnover rate, length of service, and performance to identify trends and opportunities. This can help identify problems with the organizational climate or with training and development programs.

In healthcare, Business Intelligence systems can monitor and analyze patient data, such as medical history, test results, and treatments, to identify health trends and problems and provide information for clinical decision-making.

# Business Intelligence and Big Data

Business Intelligence (BI) and Big Data are related areas. BI is a set of techniques and tools used to transform data into valuable information for making business decisions. Big Data refers to large amounts of data that come from various sources and are in different formats.

One of the main advantages of big data is the ability to process large amounts of data. It allows you to collect and store data from many different sources, including business transactions, social media data, sensor logs, and other types of unstructured data. BI uses this data to create insights and understand trends that can improve business efficiency and profitability.

Therefore, Big Data is a source of information for Business Intelligence and BI tools have adapted to deal with this amount of data. These two areas work together to help companies make better, more informed decisions.

Thus, Big Data analysis is another area in which “Self-Service” BI is taking off. This is a more recent phenomenon, but it is driving incredible growth and innovation. Big Data generally refers to large data sets that are too large to manage or queried with traditional data analysis tools. This immense volume of data is a result of the explosion of data generation, tracking, monitoring, transactional, and social networking tools (to name a few) that have become so popular in recent years.

Not only do these tools generate loads of new data, they also generate a new type of data, called "unstructured" data. Broadly speaking, unstructured data is simply data that has not been organized in a predefined way. Unlike more traditional and structured data, this type of data is largely composed of text and contains more easily defined data, such as dates or identification numbers. Examples of applications that generate this type of data include the customer behavior tracking tools you use to see what customers are doing on an e-commerce site, the log stacks, and event files generated from some devices. smart devices (such as alarms and smart sensors) and large-scale social media tracking tools.

Companies deploying these tools are being challenged not only by a sudden deluge of unstructured data rapidly reducing storage resources but, even more importantly, by finding it difficult to query this new information.

Traditional data warehousing tools (traditional relational databases and data warehouses) were not designed to manage or query unstructured data. New data storage innovations like Data Lakes are emerging to solve this need, but organizations that still rely exclusively on traditional tools when deploying applications that generate unstructured data often find themselves sitting on mountains of data that they don't know how to use. 

Data Science comprises a set of techniques and procedures for analyzing Big Data. When they meet, this is what we call Big Data Analytics.

# What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines mathematics, statistics, and computing to extract knowledge and useful insights from large data sets.

Data scientists use statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence techniques to explore and understand data, create models to predict results and communicate the insights obtained to help with decision-making. Data Science is widely used in various sectors, such as finance, healthcare, marketing, retail, and technology.

There are many examples of how Data Science can be used to improve operations and increase efficiency across different industries. Some examples include:

In marketing, a company can use Data Science techniques to analyze customer behavior data, such as purchase history, searches, and ad clicks, to better segment the target audience and personalize marketing campaigns.

In finance, a company can use data science techniques to analyze financial data, such as bank transactions and market data, to identify trends and predict future results. This can help identify investment opportunities and risks.

A company can use data science techniques to analyze sales data, such as sales volume and customer history, to predict demand and optimize sales strategies.

In operations, a company can use data science techniques to analyze production data, such as production cycle time and defect rate, to identify problems and opportunities for improvement.

In healthcare, data science systems can be used to monitor and analyze patient data, such as medical history, test results, and treatments, identify health trends, identify health problems, and provide information for decision-making. clinic.

In logistics, Data Science systems can be used to optimize delivery routes, forecast demand, and use Machine Learning algorithms to track and predict transport and logistics trends.

These are just a few examples of the wide range of Data Science applications in companies, which can be used to improve efficiency, increase revenue, and make informed decisions.

# What is Microsoft Power BI?

Microsoft Power BI is a Business Intelligence (BI) platform from Microsoft that allows users to visualize and analyze data from different sources, create interactive reports and dashboards, and share insights with other users.

Power BI allows users to connect to diverse data sources, including spreadsheets, databases, cloud services, and applications, and transform that data into valuable insights.

With Power BI, users can import, cleanse, transform, and model data, create reports and visualizations, and publish them to a shared environment (in the paid version). It also has advanced features such as interactive dashboards, data analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and report automation.

This course will use the free version of Power BI, Power BI Desktop.

# What is the Microsoft Power Platform?

Microsoft Power Platform is a cloud-based business automation and application development platform that allows users to create and customize business solutions without the need for computer programming. The platform has four main components:

Power Automate: Allows users to automate workflows such as approvals, notifications, and integrations with external applications and services using pre-built or custom rules and workflows.

Power Apps allows users to create custom web and mobile apps without coding, using pre-built or custom templates and components.

Power BI: allows users to visualize and analyze data from different sources, create interactive reports and dashboards, and share insights with other users.

Power Virtual Agents: Allows users to create custom chatbots without programming, using pre-built or custom templates and components.

The Power Platform is designed to be easy to use, scalable, and secure. It is based on the Microsoft Azure platform, allowing users to leverage Azure's security, scalability, and artificial intelligence capabilities.
