## Exercise - Position and dispersion measurements in Power BI

The available dataset has fictitious patient data. Create a descriptive analysis table in Power BI with the mean, median, and mode of patients' age, height, and weight. Additionally, answer:

1) What is the fashion for blood type?
2) What is the mode of marital status?

Create another dashboard with the same dataset. In Power BI, create a descriptive analysis table with the mean, variance, and standard deviation of patients' age, height, and weight. Additionally, calculate the coefficient of variation for the three variables.
