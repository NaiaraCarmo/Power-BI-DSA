## Miniproject 05: Financial analysis

In this mini-project, I explored some more Power BI features in the context of finance. Below is the description of the scenario:

Your company wants to have a view of revenues and expenses and asked you to create a Dashboard that allows you to analyze the following financial indicators:

1) Total Revenue
2) Total Expenses
3) Profit Margin
4) Total Revenue Per Component
5) Total Expenses Per Component in relation to the average Expenses
6) Total Income and Expenses Per Component and Per Year, with the Type/Component hierarchy.

Furthermore, the company needs to identify the segments with the highest and lowest revenues and expenses in order to draw up its strategic plan. The dataset was constructed with fictitious data.
