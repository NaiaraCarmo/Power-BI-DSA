# Practical Lab 1 - Global Sales Analytical Dashboard

In Lab 1, I build the first-course Dashboard. I worked with sales data from a fictitious company that sells products worldwide.

The Dashboard should answer the questions below:
1) What is the total value sold?
2) How many sales were made per product category?
3) How many sales were made per country considering delivery priority?
4) What was the average sales discount by product subcategory?
5) Which countries had the highest average sales value? Demonstrate on a map.

The Dashboard must also allow the user to filter the data by year, segment, and country.
